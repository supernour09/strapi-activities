step 1 => 45 min ( crash course in strapi cms )
step 2 , 3 =>  took 35 min
step 4 => took 1 hour
step 5 => took 2 hours
step 6 => took 3 hours


It looks too long but I never used strapi , I nearly read most of the documentation ,
plus the framework it self need more time to muture , don't have enough tutorials

Hope to hear from you

Thanks
